                    <h2>300</h2>
                    <p>300 is a 2007 American epic period action film based on the 1998 comic series of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. Both are fictionalized retellings of the Battle of Thermopylae within the Persian Wars. The film was co-written and directed by Zack Snyder, while Miller served as executive producer and consultant. It was filmed mostly with a superimposition chroma key technique, to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book.</p>   
                    
                    <p>The plot revolves around King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who leads 300 Spartans into battle against the Persian "God-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his invading army of more than 300,000 soldiers. As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy.</p>

                    <p>On Rotten Tomatoes, Watchmen has a 64% approval rating based on 307 reviews and an average rating of 6.35/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Gritty and visually striking, Watchmen is a faithful adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel, but its complex narrative structure may make it difficult for it to appeal to viewers not already familiar with the source material." On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating reviews from mainstream critics, the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was B on an A+ to F scale, and that the primary audience was older men.</p>

                    <p>Sucker Punch is a 2011 American psychological fantasy action film directed by Zack Snyder and co-written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya. It is Snyder's first film based on an original concept. The film stars Emily Browning as "Babydoll", a young woman who is committed to a mental institution and copes by envisioning it as a brothel. She teams up with four dancers/prisoners to escape before her scheduled lobotomy. As she collects the items she needs to escape, she enters another level of fantasy in which the women become strong, experienced warriors. Each fantasy is a parallel to the events in the brothel. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung portray the four prisoners whom Babydoll imagines as dancers. Carla Gugino plays Dr. Vera Gorski, a psychiatrist whom Babydoll imagines as Madame Gorski, a choreographer at the strip club. Oscar Isaac plays Blue Jones, the asylum's orderly; in Babydoll's mind he's the brothel's corrupt owner. The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres in the United States on March 25, 2011. The film received negative reviews and was a box office failure.</p>

                    <h2>Zack Snyder's Justice League</h2>
                    <p>Zack Snyder's Justice League, commonly referred to as the "Snyder Cut", is the upcoming director's cut of the 2017 American superhero film Justice League.

                    <p>As details surfaced about the film's troubled production and its state before Snyder stepped down, many fans expressed interest in an alternate cut more faithful to Snyder's vision. Fans and members of the cast and crew petitioned for the release of this, which they nicknamed the Snyder Cut. At the time, industry insiders regarded the release as unlikely. However, Warner Bros. decided to move ahead with it in February 2020; the following May, Snyder announced that the original cut would be released. Zack Snyder's Justice League is scheduled to be released around early to mid-2021 on HBO Max.</p>
